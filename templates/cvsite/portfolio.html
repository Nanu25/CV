                This project is a habit tracker that I built using Django. It allows users to create habits, track their progress, and view their statistics. The app is designed to help users build and maintain healthy habits by providing them with a simple and intuitive interface to track their progress. This is my final project for the CS50 course.

                This project is an E-Commerce website that I built using Django. You can list an item, make bids on the item, add the items to a watchlist, and comment on the items. The website also has a feature to close the auction and declare the winner. This project is part of the CS50 course.
