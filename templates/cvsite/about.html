        <h1>Hi, I am <span class="highlight">Grancea Alexandru</span>, and this is my programming journey!</h1>
        <p>
            I’m currently in my second year at <strong>Babeș-Bolyai University</strong> in Cluj-Napoca, where I’m pursuing my passion for computer science. From a young age, I was always curious about how the technology around us worked, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that programming was the key to understanding and shaping that world.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interest in programming truly took off in high school, where I started learning algorithms in C++. By the 10th grade, I had mastered the school curriculum and sought out new challenges. This led me to join the <strong>Center for Performance in Informatics</strong>, where I dived deep into advanced algorithms and data structures. In my final year, I was given the rewarding opportunity to teach younger students advanced algorithmic techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            To broaden my skillset, I also completed Harvard's <strong>CS50</strong> course, which introduced me to new technologies and reinforced my passion for the field. The course expanded my horizons and gave me the confidence to take on more complex projects.
